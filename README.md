### Description
Our project will consist of a story based game taking place in a fantasy universe. The main character will be the Goddess of Sight that decides to leave her role as part of a divine group and descends to the mortal realm to experience its beauty first hand. As the story unfolds, the character will undergo emotional changes and the player will be able to see that emotional curve. The game will have multiple challenges composed of puzzles the player can pass with the help of four different powers such as Telekinesis, Speed, Levitation and the Goddessâ€™ unique power, the ability to send an invisible beam of light that allows her to see everything she touches for a short period of time.
